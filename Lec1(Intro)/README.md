# 🧩 Low-Level Design (LLD) Interview Preparation

Low-Level Design (LLD) interviews test your ability to build **functional, maintainable, and scalable system components** while keeping your designs simple and extensible.

This guide provides a structured checklist and revision material to help you **ace your LLD interviews** — whether you’re a fresher or an experienced developer. 🚀

---

# 🧩 Building Blocks of LLD
## 1. Requirement Gathering:

- Understand the detailed requirements of the system. This includes identifying the functionality, constraints, and edge cases to ensure the design meets user needs. For example, in a movie ticket booking system, this would include functionality such as: 🎥🎟️

  - Seat selection 🪑
  - Payment processing 💳
  - Ticket generation 🧾
  - Simultaneous bookings for the same seat 🔄

‍

## 2. Laying Down Use Cases:

- Define specific scenarios that the system will handle, outlining inputs, actions, and expected outputs. Use cases help in clarifying the scope and guiding the design process. For a movie ticket booking system, use cases would include: 🎬

  - Booking tickets for a single user 👤
  - Handling group bookings with seat proximity 👥
  - Canceling a booking and refunding payment 💵
  Sending notifications (SMS/email) for booking confirmation 📧📱

‍

## 3. UML Diagrams:

- Create diagrams to visually represent the structure, behavior, and interactions of system components. In a movie ticket booking system, these could include: 📊

- Class Diagram: Representing entities like User, Ticket, Movie, Payment, and Theater 🎟️🎬💳🏛️
- Sequence Diagram: Showing the flow of actions for booking a ticket, including seat selection, payment processing, and confirmation 🔄💳
- Activity Diagram: Mapping the workflow for booking and canceling tickets 🔁🗓️

---

## 🧠 1. Understand the Problem Clearly

- Don’t rush to code — first clarify **requirements, constraints, and edge cases**.  
- Ask clarifying questions:
  - What are the core features?
  - What are the performance expectations?
  - Any concurrency or scalability needs?

🎯 **Goal:** Avoid incorrect assumptions early in the process.

---

## ⚙️ 2. Break Down the Requirements

Decompose the problem into smaller **modules or components**.

- Identify **entities, responsibilities, and interactions**.
- Example: *Movie Booking System*
  - User Interface
  - Seat Reservation Logic
  - Payment Service

🧩 **Think modular** → clear boundaries → easier to scale and maintain.

---

## 🧱 3. Apply Design Principles

Follow proven design rules to ensure clean, testable code.

### **SOLID Principles**
- **S** – Single Responsibility  
- **O** – Open/Closed  
- **L** – Liskov Substitution  
- **I** – Interface Segregation  
- **D** – Dependency Inversion  

### **Other Golden Rules**
- **DRY** – Don’t Repeat Yourself  
- **KISS** – Keep It Simple, Stupid  

✅ **Aim:** Maintainability | Scalability | Readability

---

## 🧩 4. Use Design Patterns Wisely

Familiarize yourself with the most common and practical design patterns.

### **Core Patterns**
- **Singleton** – Only one instance (e.g., DB connection)
- **Factory** – Object creation logic abstraction
- **Observer** – Event-driven updates
- **Strategy** – Interchangeable behaviors

💬 **Explain during interviews:**
- Why this pattern?
- What are the trade-offs?
- How does it improve the design?

Be flexible if the interviewer suggests an alternative.

---

## ⚖️ 5. Balance Simplicity & Extensibility

- Avoid **over-engineering** your solution.
- Design for **current needs**, but keep **extension points** for future growth.

### Example:
Adding new payment methods → define a `PaymentStrategy` interface and extend it.

⏱️ **Time tip:** LLD rounds are 45–60 mins — focus on core modules, not CRUD.

---

## 📚 6. Brush Up on DSA Basics

A strong DSA foundation helps make smarter design choices.

### **Understand trade-offs:**
- **HashMap** → Fast lookups, more memory.
- **PriorityQueue** → Ordered data, slower ops.

### **Example:**
LRU Cache → `HashMap + Doubly Linked List`

💡 Be ready to discuss **time & space complexity** and **why** a structure fits the problem.

---

## 🗣️ 7. Communicate Your Thought Process

Verbalize your reasoning **step-by-step**:
- Alternatives considered  
- Trade-offs analyzed  
- Final design decisions  

🗣️ Keeps the interviewer engaged and demonstrates teamwork, clarity, and analytical thinking.

---

## ⚠️ 8. Handle Edge Cases & Scalability

Think about **real-world challenges**:
- Concurrency issues  
- Traffic spikes  
- Data consistency problems  

### **Examples:**
- Movie seat booking → Use locking to avoid double-booking.  
- High traffic → Use caching, load balancers, distributed queues.

---

## 💻 9. Write Clean, Modular Code

When coding:
- Use **meaningful names**.
- Keep functions **small & focused**.
- Follow **SOLID** and design patterns.

### **Examples:**
- Use **Singleton** for shared DB connections.
- Use **Open/Closed Principle** for extensibility.

🧼 **Clean code = readable, testable, maintainable.**

---

## 🚗 10. Practice Real-World LLD Problems

Practice frequently asked design problems:

| System | Focus Area |
|---------|-------------|
| 🚙 Parking Lot | Object relationships, state mgmt |
| 📚 Library Management | CRUD, entity design |
| 🛒 Online Shopping Cart | Inventory, pricing, user session |
| 🎟️ Movie Ticket Booking | Concurrency, payments |
| 🏢 Elevator System | State mgmt, scheduling |
| 🧾 Logger System | Singleton, async logging |
| 💾 Cache (LRU/MRU) | Data structure design |

### Practice focusing on:
- Class diagrams  
- Relationships (Association, Aggregation, Composition)  
- Pattern usage  
- Data structures used
